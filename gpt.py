    3. Formality level (formal, informal, neutral)
    4. Audience assessment (professional, personal, general)
    
    For each email, provide the following feedback:
    1. Overall tone assessment based on the sentiment scores
    2. Appropriateness of tone for the detected audience and intent
    3. Suggestions for improving effectiveness based on intent
    4. Formality adjustments if needed for the audience
    5. Specific wording or phrasing recommendations
    
    Keep your feedback concise, constructive, and actionable. Focus on 2-3 key improvements that would have the most impact.
